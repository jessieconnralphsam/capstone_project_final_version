This is the README file for the IOT Based Decision Support System for NFT Hydroponics Cultured Monitored to Ion Selective Electrodes capstone project. The purpose of this project is to provide a real-time monitoring and decision support system for hydroponics farmers using nutrient film technique (NFT) and ion selective electrodes (ISE) sensors.

**Overview**
Hydroponics is a method of growing plants in nutrient-rich water without soil. NFT is a type of hydroponic system where a thin layer of water is circulated over the roots of the plants. ISE sensors are used to measure the concentration of ions in the water, which is critical for maintaining optimal nutrient levels for plant growth.
The IOT Based Decision Support System for NFT Hydroponics Cultured Monitored to Ion Selective Electrodes project provides a platform for monitoring the ISE sensors in real-time, alerting the farmer when the nutrient levels fall below or exceed the desired range, and providing recommendations for adjusting the nutrient levels based on historical data.

**Features**
The key features of this project include:

-Integration with ISE sensors to measure temperature, acidity, total dissolved solids, water flow and water level in real-time
-Real-time monitoring
-Automatic alerts when nutrient levels fall below or exceed the desired range
-Historical data
-User-friendly dashboard for visualizing the sensor data
-Integration with an IOT device for remote access to the system

Dependencies
**This project was developed using various software tool, frameworks and libraries, including:**
Arduino Uno (for the IOT device)
GSM module
materialize
PHP (backend)
bootstrap
chart.js
bootstrap 5.0
xampp
mySQL (for data storage)
HTML/CSS/JavaScript (for the web interface)
Ion selective electrodes (ISE) sensors
The specific versions of each dependency are listed in the requirements.txt file.

**How to Run**
To run the IOT Based Decision Support System for NFT Hydroponics Cultured Monitored to Ion Selective Electrodes project, you will need to set up the IOT device and install the required dependencies. Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the Flask server by running the app.py file and access the system through a web browser.
